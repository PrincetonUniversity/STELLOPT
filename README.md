# GitHub Pages
This is the branch to automatically generate GitHub Pages at https://princetonuniversity.github.io/STELLOPT/.

1. The basic syntax is markdown [(a quick cheatsheet for markdown)](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

2. [MathJax]() is configured.
```
inline
$$ J \times B = \nabla B $$
or displayed

\[ J \times B = \nabla B \]

\$$ J \times B = \nabla B $$

```
And you should get the equations printed out on the website in about one minute (might not work in the preview).

3. Table of contents will be automatically generated by extracting the titles.

4. [script.sh](script.sh) is a batchscript for converting **Creole** format to **markdown** using pandoc. You can modify it doing converts for other formats.

5. [fix_format.py](fix_format.py) is a python script to fix some known format issues.
