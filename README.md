# GitHub Pages
This is the branch to automatically generate GitHub Pages at https://princetonuniversity.github.io/STELLOPT/.

The basic syntax is markdown [(a quick cheatsheet for markdown)](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

[MathJax]() is configured and you can type equations by as following
```
inline
$ J \times B = \nabla B $
or independantly
$$ J \times B = \nabla B $$
```
And you should get the equations printed out on the GitHub Pages (might not work in the preview).

inline
$ J \times B = \nabla B $
or independantly
$$ J \times B = \nabla B $$

[script.sh](script.sh) is a batchscript for converting **Creole** format to **markdown** using pandoc. You can modify it doing converts for other formats.
