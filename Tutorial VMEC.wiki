=Tutorial: VMEC Walkthrough= 
This tutorial will walk the user through running VMEC in fixed boundary, running MAKEGRID, running VMEC in free boundary, and utilizing the various other codes based upon a VMEC equilibria. The tutorial is centered around an NCSX-like machine. This device is a quasi-axisymmetric stellarator with a field periodicity of three.[[toc]]

==VMEC: FIXED BOUNDARY== 
First let's run VMEC in fixed boundary mode. In fixed boundary, the user must specify the Fourier coefficients on the boundary and the toroidal (n) Fouier coefficients which specify the initial guess for the magnetic axis. The code then begins to solve the interior problem of minimizing the MHD functional under the assumption of good nested flux surfaces. Our fixed boundary input file ([[file:input.ncsx_fixed]]) contains a FORTRAN name list which looks like:

This produces four files wout, jxbout, mercier, and threed1. The wout file is the VMEC data file containing the converged equilibria. The jxbout file contains various quantities relating to the currents, magnetic field, and force balance on each surface. The mercier file contains a table of various stability related parameters. The threed1 file is a text file containing information regarding the execution of the code and the final state of the code. Please note that in the latest versions of VMEC the wout and jxbout files are [[https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/|netCDF]] files.

==MAKEGRID: Generating the mgrid file== 
In order to run VMEC in free boundary mode, the vacuum magnetic field must be specified on a series of toroidal cut planes for one field period of a device. The MAKEGRID routine reads a coil definition file and calculates the field due to a unit current on a series of cut planes. In order to calculate the field due to a coil, the code performs a Biot-Savart calculation over a series of line segments representing the coil. For our purposes here, we will use a modified NCSX-like coil (). The coil file has a form:

The coils file consists of a header specifying the periodicity of the system, the file type (in this case filament), and the mirror symmetry of the system. The coils are then specified by a series of data points (x,y,z,current). Each point connects to the next in the system. The last element of each coil has zero current and a current group specifier along with a name for a current group. This groups the coils by power supply (current).
Running the code in interactive mode we find:
