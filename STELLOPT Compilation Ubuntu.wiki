=STELLOPT Compilation on Ubuntu= 

This page details how to compile the STELLOPT family of codes on [[@http://www.ubuntu.com/|Ubuntu]]. In order to do so you will need to install [[@http://gcc.gnu.org/|GNU based compilers]] on your Linux machine. In principle this set of steps should work for any Linux based distribution which uses [[@https://www.debian.org/|Debian]] based package management.
