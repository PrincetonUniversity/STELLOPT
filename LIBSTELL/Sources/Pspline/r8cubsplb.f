      subroutine r8cubsplb ( tau, c, n, ibcbeg, ibcend )
c
c  from  * a practical guide to splines *  by c. de boor
c     ************************  input  ***************************
c     n = number of data points. assumed to be .ge. 2.
c     (tau(i), c(1,i), i=1,...,n) = abscissae and ordinates of the
c        data points. tau is assumed to be strictly increasing.
c     ibcbeg, ibcend = boundary condition indicators, and
c     c(2,1), c(2,n) = boundary condition information. specifically,
c        ibcbeg = 0  means no boundary condition at tau(1) is given.
c           in this case, the not-a-knot condition is used, i.e. the
c           jump in the third derivative across tau(2) is forced to
c           zero, thus the first and the second cubic polynomial pieces
c           are made to coincide.)
c        ibcbeg = 1  means that the slope at tau(1) is made to equal
c           c(2,1), supplied by input.
c        ibcbeg = 2  means that the second derivative at tau(1) is
c           made to equal c(2,1), supplied by input.
c        ibcend = 0, 1, or 2 has analogous meaning concerning the
c           boundary condition at tau(n), with the additional infor-
c           mation taken from c(2,n).
c     ***********************  output  **************************
c     c(j,i), j=1,...,4; i=1,...,l (= n-1) = the polynomial coefficients
c        of the cubic interpolating spline with interior knots (or
c        joints) tau(2), ..., tau(n-1). precisely, in the interval
c        (tau(i), tau(i+1)), the spline f is given by
c           f(x) = c(1,i)+h*(c(2,i)+h*(c(3,i)+h*c(4,i)/3.)/2.)
c        where h = x - tau(i). the function program *ppvalu* may be
c        used to evaluate f or its derivatives from tau,c, l = n-1,
c        and k=4.
