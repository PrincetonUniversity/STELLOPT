=Tutorial: BOOTSJ Calculation= 
This tutorial will walk the user through running the [[BOOTSJ]] code. For this example the National Compact Stellarator Experiment (NCSX) configuration will be used. This machine is stellarator symmetric with a periodicity of three. To generate the necessary files see the tutorials [[VMEC Fixed Boundary Run|VMEC Fixed Boundary Tutorial]] and [[Boozer Transformation for NCSX-Like Configuration|Boozer Transform Tutorial]]. You will need a 'boozmn' file to run this simulation and the VMEC 'input' file.

----

# __**Edit the input namelist text file.**__
> The BOOTSJ code will look in the input file for the BOOTIN namelist. We will make use of the TEMPRES variable to choose the temperatures to be consistent with the [[VMEC]] pressure profile. Thus the density will be constant.
