	Abstract = {The control of impurity accumulation is one of the main challenges for future stellarator fusion reactors. The standard argument to explain this accumulation relies on the, in principle, large inward pinch in the neoclassical impurity flux caused by the typically negative radial electric field in stellarators. This simplified interpretation was proven to be flawed by Helander et al (2017 Phys. Rev. Lett . 118 155002), who showed that in a relevant regime (low-collisionality main ions and collisional impurities) the radial electric field does not drive impurity transport. In that reference, the effect of the component of the electric field that is tangent to the magnetic surface was not included. In this letter, an analytical calculation of the neoclassical radial impurity flux incorporating such effect is given, showing that it can be very strong for highly charged impurities and that, once it is taken into account, the dependence of the impurity flux on the radial electric field reappears. Realistic examples are provided in which the inclusion of the tangential electric field leads to impurity expulsion.},

	Abstract = {The implementation of ideal ballooning stability within an optimization code is used to determine stable, moderate-β compact stellarator configurations. Due to the large computational requirements of existing ballooning codes, such calculations within the optimization process were previously impractical. The recently developed COBRA code can efficiently compute ideal ballooning growth rates on various magnetic surfaces, using the VMEC code to supply equilibrium data. The optimization code has been used to minimize these growth rates, giving rise to new stellarator configurations at low aspect ratios with good ballooning stability properties, which also maintain previously determined desirable physics properties. This particular implementation is robust due to the enhanced convergence features included in COBRA, while incurring only a small overhead on the total computational time.},

	Abstract = {As the finalization of a hydrogen experiment towards the deuterium phase, the exploration of the best performance of hydrogen plasma was intensively performed in the large helical device. High ion and electron temperatures, T i and T e , of more than 6 keV were simultaneously achieved by superimposing high-power electron cyclotron resonance heating onneutral beam injection (NBI) heated plasma. Although flattening of the ion temperature profile in the core region was observed during the discharges, one could avoid degradation by increasing the electron density. Another key parameter to present plasma performance is an averaged beta value ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/57/10/102023/nfaa7fc2ieqn001.gif] {$\left\langle \beta \right\rangle $} . The high ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/57/10/102023/nfaa7fc2ieqn002.gif] {$\left\langle \beta \right\rangle $} regime around 4% was extended to an order of magnitude lower than the earlier collisional regime. Impurity behaviour in hydrogen discharges with NBI heating was also classified with a wide range of edge plasma parameters. The existence of a no impurity accumulation regime, where the high performance plasma is maintained with high power heating  >10 MW, was identified. Wide parameter scan experiments suggest that the toroidal rotation and the turbulence are the candidates for expelling impurities from the core region.},

@article{burhenn2009imp,
	Abstract = {The Large Helical Device (LHD) and Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X, under construction) are experiments specially designed to demonstrate long-pulse (quasi steady state) operation, which is an intrinsic property of stellarators and heliotrons. Significant progress has been made in establishing high performance plasmas. A crucial point is the increasing impurity confinement at high density observed at several machines (TJ-II, W7-AS, LHD) which can lead to impurity accumulation and early pulse termination by radiation collapse. In addition, theoretical predictions for non-axisymmetric configurations predict the absence of impurity screening by ion temperature gradients in standard ion-root plasmas. Nevertheless, scenarios were found where impurity accumulation was successfully avoided in LHD and W7-AS due to the onset of friction forces in the (high density and low temperature) scrape-off-layer (SOL), the generation of magnetic islands at the plasma boundary and to a certain degree also by edge localized modes, flushing out impurities and reducing the net impurity influx into the core. In both the W7-AS high density H-mode regime and in the case of application of sufficient electron cyclotron radiation heating power a reduction in impurity core confinement was observed. The exploration of such purification mechanisms is a demanding task for successful steady-state operation. Impurity transport at the plasma edge/SOL was identified to play a major role for the global impurity behaviour in addition to the core confinement.},

@article{tamura2016mitigation,
	Abstract = {The mitigation of a tracer impurity accumulation in the core region of high-temperature helical plasma was clearly observed by applying electron cyclotron heating (ECH) in the large helical device (LHD). In the LHD, the accumulation of impurities toward the centre of the plasma has been observed in a high-density regime. In this study, for observing clearly the behaviour of impurity ions in the plasma core, the extrinsic `tracer' impurity was injected into that region by means of a tracer-encapsulated solid pellet (TESPEL). The high-density LHD plasma without ECH definitely shows the strong impurity accumulation, and then it causes the reduction in electron and ion temperatures in the core region. When ECH was applied just after the TESPEL injection, the accumulation of the tracer impurity ions was mitigated. Even after ECH was switched-off, the intensities of the line emissions from the highly-ionized tracer impurity were increased very slightly. The micro-turbulence measurement with a 2-dimensional phase contrast imaging diagnostic during ECH does not support the view that the change in the micro-turbulence would enhance the outward flow (an increase in a diffusive flux, a decrease in an inward convective flux and/or a change the direction of the convective flux from inward to outward) of the impurity ions. Moreover, at this moment, there is no conclusive data regarding a radial electric field measured with a charge exchange spectroscopy diagnostic to support the view that the change in the radial electric field would be attributed to the increment in the outward flow of the impurity ions from the core region of the LHD plasma.},

	Abstract = {The progress in the understanding of the physics and the concurrent parameter extension in the large helical device since the last IAEA-FEC, in 2012 (Kaneko O et al 2013 Nucl. Fusion 53 095024), is reviewed. Plasma with high ion and electron temperatures ( T i(0) ∼ T e (0) ∼ 6 keV) with simultaneous ion and electron internal transport barriers is obtained by controlling recycling and heating deposition. A sign flip of the nondiffusive term of impurity/momentum transport (residual stress and convection flow) is observed, which is associated with the formation of a transport barrier. The impact of the topology of three-dimensional magnetic fields (stochastic magnetic fields and magnetic islands) on heat momentum, particle/impurity transport and magnetohydrodynamic stability is also discussed. In the steady state operation, a 48 min discharge with a line-averaged electron density of 1 × 10 19 m −3 and with high electron and ion temperatures ( T i(0) ∼ T e (0) ∼ 2 keV), resulting in 3.36 GJ of input energy, is achieved.},

	Abstract = {The optimized, superconducting stellarator Wendelstein 7-X went into operation and delivered first measurement data after 15 years of construction and one year commissioning. Errors in the magnet assembly were confirmend to be small. Plasma operation was started with 5 MW electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) power and five inboard limiters. Core plasma values of ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0741-3335/59/1/014018/ppcfaa405fieqn001.gif] {${{T}_{\text{e}}}>8$} keV, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0741-3335/59/1/014018/ppcfaa405fieqn002.gif] {${{T}_{\text{i}}}>2$} keV at line-integrated densities ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0741-3335/59/1/014018/ppcfaa405fieqn003.gif] {$n\approx 3\centerdot {{10}^{19}}~{{\text{m}}^{-2}}$} were achieved, exceeding the original expectations by about a factor of two. Indications for a core-electron-root were found. The energy confinement times are in line with the international stellarator scaling, despite unfavourable wall conditions, i.e. large areas of metal surfaces and particle sources from the limiter close to the plasma volume. Well controlled shorter hydrogen discharges at higher power (4 MW ECRH power for 1 s) and longer discharges at lower power (0.7 MW ECRH power for 6 s) could be routinely established after proper wall conditioning. The fairly large set of diagnostic systems running in the end of the 10 weeks operation campaign provided first insights into expected and unexpected physics of optimized stellarators.},

@article{regana2017phi1,
	Abstract = {The impurity transport in magnetically confined plasmas under some conditions finds neither quantitatively nor qualitatively a satisfactory theory-based explanation. This compromises the successful realization of thermo-nuclear fusion for energy production since impurity accumulation is known to be one of the causes that limits the plasma performance through radiative losses and plasma dilution. Under stellarator reactor-relevant conditions, accumulation is supported by the negative (inwards pointing) radial electric field which must arise to satisfy the ambipolarity constraint on the neoclassical particle fluxes. The high charge number of the impurities makes their transport particularly sensitive to the presence of electric fields and, consequently, the electrostatic potential variation on the flux surface, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/57/5/056004/nfaa5fd5ieqn001.gif] {${{\Phi}_{1}}$} , which conventional neoclassical theory usually neglects, may contribute to the theoretical interpretation of experimental results not yet fully understood, e.g. Ida et al (2009 Phys. Plasmas 16 056111) and Yoshinuma et al (2009 Nucl. Fusion 49 062002). In the present work we have considered different stellarator configurations and assessed the impact that ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/57/5/056004/nfaa5fd5ieqn002.gif] {${{\Phi}_{1}}$} has on the radial particle transport of selected impurities. The results for LHD show that ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/57/5/056004/nfaa5fd5ieqn003.gif] {${{\Phi}_{1}}$} can strongly modify this transport, resulting in large deviations of the level of inward impurity flux predicted by the standard neoclassical theory in most cases. In Wendelstein 7-X, on the contrary, ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0029-5515/57/5/056004/nfaa5fd5ieqn004.gif] {${{\Phi}_{1}}$} is significantly smaller and, for the parameters considered, its effect only appreciable for impurities with high charge number. Finally, in TJ-II the potential variation leads to appreciable changes of the impurity radial flux, although not to the extent its large amplitude might lead one to think. The dependence on the chosen parameters and open questions for future developments are discussed.},

@article{calvo2017sqrtnu,
	Abstract = {In general, the orbit-averaged radial magnetic drift of trapped particles in stellarators is non-zero due to the three-dimensional nature of the magnetic field. Stellarators in which the orbit-averaged radial magnetic drift vanishes are called omnigeneous, and they exhibit neoclassical transport levels comparable to those of axisymmetric tokamaks. However, the effect of deviations from omnigeneity cannot be neglected in practice, and it is more deleterious at small collisionalities. For sufficiently low collision frequencies (below the values that define the ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0741-3335/59/5/055014/ppcfaa63ceieqn1.gif] {$1/\nu $} regime), the components of the drifts tangential to the flux surface become relevant. This article focuses on the study of such collisionality regimes in stellarators close to omnigeneity when the gradient of the non-omnigeneous perturbation is small. First, it is proven that closeness to omnigeneity is required to actually preserve radial locality in the drift-kinetic equation for collisionalities below the ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0741-3335/59/5/055014/ppcfaa63ceieqn2.gif] {$1/\nu $} regime. Then, using the derived radially local equation, it is shown that neoclassical transport is determined by two layers located at different regions of phase space. One of the layers corresponds to the so-called ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0741-3335/59/5/055014/ppcfaa63ceieqn3.gif] {$\sqrt{\nu }$} regime and the other to the so-called superbanana-plateau regime. The importance of the superbanana-plateau layer for the calculation of the tangential electric field is emphasized, as well as the relevance of the latter for neoclassical transport in the collisionality regimes considered in this paper. In particular, the role of the tangential electric field is essential for the emergence of a new subregime of superbanana-plateau transport when the radial electric field is small. A formula for the ion energy flux that includes the ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0741-3335/59/5/055014/ppcfaa63ceieqn4.gif] {$\sqrt{\nu }$} regime and the superbanana-plateau regime is given. The energy flux scales with the square of the size of the deviation from omnigeneity. Finally, it is explained why below a certain collisionality value the formulation presented in this article ceases to be valid.},
