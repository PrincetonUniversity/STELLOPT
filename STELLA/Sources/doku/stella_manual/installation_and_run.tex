\section{Setting up \stella~on a new system}

The first time that you try to run~\stella, you may need to install some software, and to set a few environment variables.

\subsection{System requirements}

In order to compile and run \stella, your system should already have installed:

\begin{itemize}
\item The \href{http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/}{\PETSC} library for solving large linear systems.
\item An implementation of \MPI for parallel runs.
\item \href{http://www.fftw.org}{\FFTW} for computing the discrete Fourier transform.
\end{itemize}
