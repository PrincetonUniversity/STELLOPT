  there but there is no option to switch between the axis.

            SHORTCUTS 
            ---------
  * CTRL+S or F1 will replot the graph.


            TAB 1: SELECTED FILES   
            ---------------------

  * Select input files and sort them by simulations and experiments to create a research object.
        - Click "Select simulations" to select input files one by one, or a bunch with ctrl+click
        - Click "Select folders" to select all the input files in a given folder, to select the files
          go inside the folder then click "OK", the prompt will open again to allow you to select 
          more folders, when all the folders have been selected click "Cancel". Unfortunatly tkinter
          does not offer an easy way to select multiple folders at once without designing your own
          file selection menu. (TODO: OPTIONAL)
        - Click "Clear simulations" to remove all the selected files and to start again. 
  * Save research objects to "stellapy/config/research" by clicking the "Save research" button.
  * Load a saved research object from "stellapy/config/research" by clicking the "Load research" button.
  * A simulation is a group of input files that are identical except for the modes (kx,ky), or that are identical
    besides the restart parameters or the resolution settings, since we tweak the resolution to obtain convergence.
        - This allows us to run 1 mode per file but still consider these input files to be one simulation. 
        - This allows is to merge the reruns of a nonlinear simulation.
  * An experiment is a group of simulations that are linked for some reason (see next point). This allows
    us to create two dimensions in plots: the line color/label/style indicates experiments and the marker
    color/label/style defines simulations. 
        - E.g. we have two shots of wendelstein 7-X (= two line styles) and 4 radial positions (= 4 markers).
  * The division in experiments can be controlled by toggling ("Ignore resolution", "Include resolution")
    and by choosing the number of varied parameters in the simulations. Moreover, by right-clicking the 
    varied parameters button we can force the code to consider files in a different folder a different experiment. 
        - When scanning fprim and tprim we have 3 varied parameters (feprim, fiprim and tiprim) and we ignore the resolution. 
        - When looking at the influence of the resolution by scanning delta t we have 1 varied parameter and we 
          include the division based on the resolution parameters. 
        - We can compare scans of dt for different varied parameters, by choosing "1 folder =  1 experiment".
  * Progress bar shows what is happening in the backend, when this is frozen, an error occured which is displayed
    on the command prompt, therefore it is recommanded to run from the command prompt and not as a desktop application.
  * The right side of the tab shows the basic input parameters which are read from all the selected input files. The
    data in gray represents the default values which are set by stella itself. The black values indicate values that 
    are set by the input files and which do not equal the default values of stella. The red values are the values that
    differ between the selected input files. In the frame "All parameters" one can toggle between the namelists that are 
    present in stella to view all the possible variables in stella. Some namelists are split in "namelist" and
    "namelust_more" since they were too long. The top right shows the species that are present and each species
    is accesible by clicking the tab. Although adiabatic electrons are not technically a species, their temperature
    can be calculated based on the "tite" variable which is show in the "adiabatic electrons" tab. Hovering over
    the variables will give a small explanation of their use and meaning (not complete yet.)
        - The variables display allows one to quickly check the input parameters, more specifcally the modes, 
          gradients and the resolution. As well as seeing the difference between the input files.

     MODIFICATIONS
#========================================================

26/01/2021
  * Moved the time frame to calculate the saturated fluxes in to the simulation.ini file, this way it
    only needs to be set properly once and the time frame will be remembered. 
  * Added a normalization option for the nonlinear fluxes that normalizes the fluxes by their saturated
    value and the time by the time of the end of the ramp-up. This way the shape of the fluxes can be 
    easily compared. E.g. to see how resolution affects the saturation. 

16/12/2020
  * Added the bash command kyscan as a pythons script with a bash interface.

15/12/2020
  * Changed the open files and open directories dialogs to be more pretty, efficient and to be able
    to select multiple folders at once with CTRL+CLICK or CTRL+A.

11-13/12/2020
  * STELLA: to unload module hfd5 add a --force flag
  * Remoddeled TBA4 to have one option frame for each of the three graphs to have it more organized.
  * Added the option to plot gamma/k_y**2 to TAB4
  * A folder can be deleted by pressing "delete" in the simulations list
  * Show the marker and line label for each input_file in the simulations list
  * Sort experiments based on a stella knob and key by richtclicking the "varied parameters" button.

10/12/2020
  * Add the possibility to plot z-data = [gamma, omega, ky] on TAB5
  * Add interpolation of z-data on TAB5

09/12/2020

  * Changed the mode identifier in the simulation.ini file
  * Fixed a big with the right simulation not showing up
  * Fixed nonlinear diagnostics tab (TAB5)
  * Add possibility to manually choose time frames for the calculation of the saturated flux

03/12/2020

  * Changed the default directory to save figures to CONFIG[Paths][Figures] instead of "~/"
  * Fixed a bug on TAB2 where the correct simulation was not showing.
  * Fixed a bug on TAB3 where the xlims and ylims would break when encountering NaNs
  * Fixed a bug on TAB3 where the correct experiments/simulations were not showing.

02/12/2020:     

  * Write linear data and stable/unstable and converged/unconverged modes to a file called simulation.ini
    This will speed up the plotting since this data requires some time consuming calculations that only
    have to be executed once and return a very small amount of data which can be easily saved in a .ini file.
    In order to prevent rewriting this file, the last modified data of the most recent file will be saved in the 
    .ini file, comparing this each time the .ini file is read will be able to determine whether the data needs
    to be recalculated and rewritten. E.g. when the resolution of a mode is changed, the files are modified, the 
    last modified data is updated and therefore the simulation.ini file will be rewritten.
  * The simulation.ini file also allows to manually remove modes along x and y by adding them to ["remove_k_modes"]
  * Fixed the potential versus z.

01/12/2020:  

  * Wrote a function to popup warning messages and made sure it poppes up in the middle of the screen, 
    even when using dual screens.
  * Added error bars to the linear spectra plots on TAB3
  * Add the functionality to remove specific modes from the spectra by listing them in the folder.
  * Simplified the conversion of (kx,ky) data to a one dimensional scan of data.
  * Fixed a bug on TAB2 where the correct experiment was not showing.
