The Drift Kinetic Equation Solver (DKES)<ref>[[http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.859116|W. I. van Rij and S. P. Hirshman, Variational Bounds for Transport Coefficients in Three-Dimensional Plasmas, Phys. Fluids B 1,563(1989)]]</ref> solves a set of 3D drift kinetic equations to obtain upper and lower bounds for the diffusion coefficients of a prescribed toroidal plasma equilibrium. The three dimensions are theta (poloidal angle), zeta (toroidal angle), and alpha (pitch angle). Straight-line flux coordinates are used to describe the equilibrium, which must satisfy the stellarator symmetry conditions.
