Ft minimisation using the local normalisation of fT (i.e., using <B^2> rather than psi0).
-input.copy: minimise f_T at various points targeting the aspect ratio as well. (slurm.1078463)
	The execution seemed to stop for some memory issue. The analysis shows that f_T was
	reduced (though seemingly not monomotonically when compared to the psi0 normalisation f_T),
	noticeably leading to a reduction in QS residual, but tilting the curves rather than 
	displacing them downwards. epseff seems to be going in the opposite direction to the 
	f_T trend. The final product also seems to look worse than the usual f_B situation.
